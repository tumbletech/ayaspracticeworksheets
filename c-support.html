                <h1>Support Our Educational Mission: Provide Free Learning Materials for All</h1>
                <p>Aya's Educational Worksheets started as a way to keep our daughter, Aya, learning during her downtime. We wanted to make her time productive and fun, and it turned out to be a great way for her to build skills and confidence. Seeing how much she enjoyed it and how much she learned, we felt inspired to share these worksheets with other families.</p>
                <p>Again, we believe that <strong>education is a right, not a privilege.</strong> By offering these worksheets for free, we aim to help children gain access to educational materials, regardless of their circumstances - as long as they have internet connection.</p>
