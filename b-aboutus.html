            <h1>About Aya’s Educational Worksheets</h1>

                <p>We, Aya's parents, believe in the saying: "Education is a right, not a privilege." That's why we launched this project - to make educational resources accessible to every child,
                    regardless of background or circumstance - as long as there is an internet connection.
                </p>

                <p>Our goal is to support early childhood learning by offering <strong>free, quality worksheets </strong>that build strong foundational skills in <strong>math, reading, and creativity.</strong> 
                This activities are designed to make learning enjoyable while helping minds develop essential skills that will serve them throughout their academic journey.</p>
                
                <p>It all started as a personal project for our daughter. We created these worksheets to keep her engaged and build her skills during her free time. Seeing how much progress she made, we
                    realized that other parents and educators might benefit from them too. So we decided to share our collection.
                </p>

                <p>Whether you are a parent, teacher, or caregiver, we hope these resources help you support your child's learning journey - without any barriers or costs. Join us in making <strong>
                foundational education accessible </strong>to every child, everywhere.</p>

            <h4 class="disclaimer-h">Disclaimer</h4>
            <p class="disclaimer-text">All the worksheets available on this site are created by us, Aya's parents. Our primary goal is to <strong>supplement the educational materials </strong>already provided
            by schools and any tutorial centers a child may be enrolled in. This project is not intended to <strong>replace formal education or professional tutoring.</strong></p>
            <p class="disclaimer-text">Additionally, while our worksheets are designed to encourage learning and practice, they are not intended to <strong>accurately measure the progress or proficiency of every
                child </strong>using them. Each child learns at their own pace, and we encourage parents and educators to use these materials as <strong>additional support </strong>rather
            than a definitive assessment tool.</p>
            <p class="disclaimer-text">Furthermore, we do not <strong>guarantee improvements in a child's academic performance </strong>through the use of these worksheets alone. The effectiveness of learning
            ultimately depends on the <strong>guidance and involvement of parents or guardians</strong> in teaching and supporting their child's educational journey.</p>
