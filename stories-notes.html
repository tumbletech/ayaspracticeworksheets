        <h2>📚 EDCOM 2 Reports: 18 Million Functionally Illiterate Graduates</h2>
            <p>On April 30, 2025, the Philippine Senate’s Committee on Basic Education released a sobering statement:</p>

            <p><a href="https://web.senate.gov.ph/press_release/2025/0430_edcom1.asp" class="blog1" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">Around 18 million Filipinos graduated high school without being functionally literate.</a></p>

            <p>This revelation came during a Senate hearing featuring findings from the Functional Literacy, Education, and Mass Media Survey (FLEMMS) conducted by the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The survey tracks basic reading comprehension, writing, and problem-solving abilities across the population.

            According to Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, chairperson of the Second Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM 2):

            “That means one out of five of our [high school] graduates cannot comprehend or understand a simple story. And that’s something we need to address.”

            He cited miseducation as a key factor, aggravated by insufficient funding and lack of systemic support.

            We trust that the government is working to resolve these deep-rooted issues. But while change at the national level may take time, we as parents don’t have to wait.

            <h4>In other words, we have an illiteracy problem!</h4>
        </p>

            <h3>✏️ The Spirit of Trying Something</h3>
            <p>Former U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt once said:

            “It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something.”

            And that’s exactly what we did.</p>

            <br>

            <h3>🌱 Aya’s Educational Worksheets Is That “Try Something”</h3>
            <p>When we noticed that traditional systems weren’t meeting our daughter’s learning needs, we didn’t wait. We didn’t blame. We tried something.

            We printed a worksheet. Sat beside her. Guided her every day. And slowly, it worked.

            What started as a simple effort to help one child turned into a movement that’s now helping thousands.</p>

            <p>Aya’s Educational Worksheets is not a curriculum. It’s not a miracle fix.</p>
            <p>It’s a tool—a simple, consistent, parent-powered solution.</p>
            <p>It’s for those who believe that home is where education really begins.</p>

            <h3>💡 You Don’t Have to Fix Everything — Just Start Something</h3>
            <p>18 million is a big number. But your child is <strong>only one</strong>.</p>
            <p>And one child, consistently supported, can overcome a flawed system.</p>

            <p>So don’t wait.</p>
            <p>Try something.</p>
            <p>Even if it’s just one worksheet a day.</p>

            Because doing something is always better than doing nothing.
            And that small act?
            It might just be the difference that matters.
