                        This platform began as a personal solution-a parent creating tools for their child. It's an initiative, built with purpose.<br><br>

                        This is not a venture. This is a quiet movement reminding families that, when it comes to reinforcing their children's education, they can build what they need, starting at home.

                        Aya's Educational Worksheets were built primarily to <strong>share the worksheets prepared for Aya </strong>by here mom and dad.<br>

                        Since each worksheet was originally made just for her, it felt like a waste <strong>(sayang)</strong> to use them only once. So instead of letting them gather digital dust or
                        put them in the Recycle Bin, Aya's mom and dad decided to share them - maybe they could help other kids too.<br>

                        This isn't just a site. It's Aya's learning journey, opened up for others to walk alongside her.

                       You can download the free materials without signing up, logging in, or giving out personal information. We do not monitor who downloads them, how often, or from where.<br>

                       Our goal is simple: if the worksheets can help your child, feel free to take them. No tracking, no pressure, no hidden agenda.

                        Right now, our worksheets are designed for <strong>Kinder learners</strong>, because that’s where Aya is in her journey. As she grows, so will the content. The platform is built to evolve alongside her.<br>

                        Long-term, we plan to offer materials for <strong>higher levels</strong>—including <strong>Physics, Chemistry, and advanced Math</strong>. That’s part of the vision. And with enough support, we might just get there sooner than expected.

                        Not really. We don’t enforce a specific schedule.

                        Aya’s worksheets were made to fit into any <strong>quiet moment</strong>—whether that’s after school, during weekends, or while waiting at a clinic. What matters more than timing is consistency and parental support. You know your child’s rhythm best—go with what works for them.

                        8.	We noticed the worksheets are repetitive. Why is that?

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <strong>Repetition is intentional</strong>. Children thrive on repeated exposure and practice. Our worksheets are structured to help kids master concepts gradually.<br>
                        Repetition builds confidence, reinforces learning, and leads to those satisfying “Aha!” moments.

                    <button class="accordion-button collapsed" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapse9">
                        9.	Are the worksheets designed to increase skills and knowledge, or just for practice?
                    </button>
                </h2>
                <div id="collapse9" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        Both. While the worksheets offer plenty of practice, they are carefully designed to <strong>develop foundational skills, reinforce key concepts, and encourage natural discovery.</strong> 
                        We don’t spoon-feed lessons—we build them gradually. 
                        Over time, children increase not just their ability to answer, but their <strong>understanding</strong> of <em>why</em> their answers work.

                        10.	Can we use our child’s progress on these worksheets as a reference for school reports or evaluations?

                </h2>
                <div id="collapse10" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        <strong>No.</strong><br>

                        While the worksheets can support your child’s learning, they are <strong>not official academic materials</strong> and are <strong>not aligned with any specific curriculum.</strong> 
                        They were made for personal development, not for institutional assessment.<br>

                        If your school requires documentation, it’s best to use their official tools and standards.

                        11.	Are you just a Kinder-only platform?

                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        Not necessarily. While the current materials are designed for Kindergarten learners (because that's where Aya is now), the platform isn't locked to one level.<br>

                        As Aya moves forward, <strong>so will the content.</strong> We're building as she grows - and if helps your child too, that's a bonus.

                <div id="collapse12" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#faqAccordion">
                    <div class="accordion-body">
                        Definitely! We're just getting started. Some upgrades currently on the table include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>More worksheet categories (Science, Filipino, Writing Practice, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Interactive digital worksheets</li>
                            <li>Mobile app version</li>
                            <li>Progress dashboard per child</li>

                        </ul>

                        However, as mentioned earlier, we're building all this with limited manpower and zero outside funding. So while these plans are in motion, they'll take time.
                        Still, if you want to help move things faster-support us or share the platform. Every bit makes a difference.

                        The worksheets aren't a <strong>one-size-fits-all solution</strong> or a magic fix. They worked for our daughter <strong>because we supported her </strong> consistently
                        while she used them.<br>

                        Every child is different. Some may thrive with these materials, others might need a different approach. But if our worksheets can play even a small part in your child's
                        progress, we're happy to share them.

                        turnaround (since we are a small team), we're open to collaborating or guiding you on how to create something tailored for your child.<br>
                        
                        Sometimes, one conversation can lead to something great-for your child and for others too.

                        <strong>Mom </strong>is a stay-at-home mom-and a Law graduate.<br>

                        We combine technical knowledge, structure, and care to design worksheets that are both educational and child-friendly. Each one is crafted with Aya in mind-
                        and shared in the hope that it can help your child too.

                        Because that's the reality we're preparing our children for.<br>

                        This isn't about colonial mentality-it's about <strong>equipping kids with the tools they need to thrive in a global environment.</strong> <em>English is the language 
                        of international business, science, and technology.</em> Whether they become engineers, writers, doctors, or entrepreneurs, <strong>proficiency in English opens more doors.</strong><br>

                        We love our native language - Tagalog. But we also love giving our children the best possible chances.<br>

                        And for us, that means mastering English-not as rejection of our roots, but as a bold step toward the future.

                        outside materials.<br>

                        Keep in mind that <strong>Aya's Educational Worksheets did not follow any specific academic curriculum.</strong> The worksheets are based on what works for Aya, and
                        are meant to supplement-not replace-existing schoolwork.<br>

                        We trust that teachers and parents alike will know how to use them in the best way for their learners.
